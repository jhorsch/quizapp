Which Chicago Neighborhood Are You?

1. Your summers are best spent?

Swimming in the lake, running along the lake, chillin' by the lake

At neighborhood festivals and places with out-door seating

I work all summer and never get to go outside

In my back yard firing up the old barbeque!

Let me get out of Chicago and into the country

2. When parking you prefer to?

I will pay whatever the price as long as I'm in the right neighborhood

I enjoy a brisk five-minute walk from my car to my home

I don't care about parking. I don't use a car

Brrr. With ice-cold Chicago winters I want to park near my house

I want to park inside my living room and not pay a cent

3. What's your favorite baseball team?

Cubs of course, this will be the year!

I proudly wear my Cubs shirt but I can't name a single outfielder

I don't really care about Chicago teams

Baseball is boring!

I'll go to a Sox game once in a while

Sox rule, I even understand what Ozzie is saying

4. What do you do?

I'm working hard to support my family

Steadily building my career

Thanks to the economy I'm in between jobs

I just got my first real job

I have this gig until my record goes platinum

I'm a student

5. On a Friday evening you prefer to:

PARTAY!

Check out the newest restaurant or hit the clubs

Go watch a movie or maybe meet my friends at a bar

I might meet up with friends but most likely I'll stay home

Relax at home, read a good book or watch TV
