3. What's your favorite baseball team?

Cubs of course, this will be the year!

I proudly wear my Cubs shirt but I can't name a single outfielder

I don't really care about Chicago teams

Baseball is boring!

I'll go to a Sox game once in a while

Sox rule, I even understand what Ozzie is saying

4. What do you do?

I'm working hard to support my family

Steadily building my career

Thanks to the economy I'm in between jobs

I just got my first real job

I have this gig until my record goes platinum

I'm a student

5. On a Friday evening you prefer to:

PARTAY!

Check out the newest restaurant or hit the clubs

Go watch a movie or maybe meet my friends at a bar

I might meet up with friends but most likely I'll stay home

Relax at home, read a good book or watch TV
